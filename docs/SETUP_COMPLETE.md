## Claude Desktop Integration

Add this to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration:

**For Simplified Server:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmx-trading-simple": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/path/to/your/gmx_server_simple.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Full Server:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gmx-trading": {
      "command": "python", 
      "args": ["C:/path/to/your/gmx_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Available Commands

### Setup & Configuration
- `setup_wallet(private_key, wallet_address, chain)` - Configure your wallet
- `get_wallet_info()` - View current configuration

### Market Data & Analysis
- `get_gmx_markets()` - Available markets
- `estimate_trading_costs(market, size_usd, is_long, chain)` - Cost estimation
- `create_trading_plan(market, direction, size_usd, collateral_usd, ...)` - Detailed planning

### Trading Operations (Full Server Only)
- `create_swap_order(...)` - Token swaps
- `create_increase_position_order(...)` - Open/increase positions
- `close_position(...)` - Close positions

- `help_gmx_trading()` - Command reference

## Example Usage in Claude

```
# Setup your wallet
setup_wallet("your_private_key_here", "0xYourWalletAddress", "arbitrum")

# Get market information
get_gmx_markets()

# Plan a trade
create_trading_plan("ETH", "long", 1000, 100, 2000, 1800, 2200)

# Estimate costs
estimate_trading_costs("ETH", 1000, true, "arbitrum")

# Get help
help_gmx_trading()
```

- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Clear warnings about risks and best practices

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Simplified Server**: Begin with `gmx_server_simple.py` to learn and plan
2. **Configure Claude Desktop**: Add the MCP server to your configuration
3. **Test Commands**: Try the example commands above
4. **Learn Trading**: Use `get_trading_tutorial()` for comprehensive education
5. **Upgrade When Ready**: Move to full server for actual trading

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Unicode Errors**: Use the simplified server on Windows
2. **Import Errors**: Run `pip install pyyaml fastmcp` for basic dependencies
3. **Build Errors**: Use simplified server to avoid C++ compilation issues

### Getting Help
